Two Sum
---

Given an array of integers, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.

The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2. Please note that your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are not zero-based.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

Input: numbers={2, 7, 11, 15}, target=9
Output: index1=1, index2=2 


```js
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @param {number} target
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var twoSum = function(nums, target) {
    var result = [];
    	for(var i = 0, len = nums.length; i < len; i++){
    		for(var j = i+1; j < len; j++){
    			if(target - nums[i] == nums[j]){
    				result.push(i+1);
    				result.push(j+1);
    				break;
    			}
    		}
    	}
    	return result;
};
```

Add Two Numbers
---

You are given two linked lists representing two non-negative numbers. The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.

Input: (2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)
Output: 7 -> 0 -> 8

```js
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * function ListNode(val) {
 *     this.val = val;
 *     this.next = null;
 * }
 */
/**
 * @param {ListNode} l1
 * @param {ListNode} l2
 * @return {ListNode}
 */
var addTwoNumbers = function(l1, l2) {
    var l3 = {},
        sum = 0,
        l3Bak = {},
        next1 = {},
        next2 = {};
    sum = l1.val + l2.val;
    l3 = new ListNode(sum % 10);
    sum = Math.floor(sum / 10);
    l3Bak = l3;
    next1 = l1.next;
    next2 = l2.next;
    while (next1 || next2 || sum !== 0) {
        sum = (next1 !== null ? next1.val : 0) + (next2 !== null ? next2.val : 0) + sum;
        l3Bak.next = new ListNode(sum % 10);
        sum = Math.floor(sum / 10);
        l3Bak = l3Bak.next;
        next1 = next1 ? next1.next : null;
        next2 = next2 ? next2.next : null;
    }

    return l3;
}

Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
---

Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters. For example, the longest substring without repeating letters for "abcabcbb" is "abc", which the length is 3. For "bbbbb" the longest substring is "b", with the length of 1.

```js
var lengthOfLongestSubstring = function(s) {
    if (s === "") return 0;
    var res,
        current = 1,
        len = s.length,
        max = 1;

    for (var i = 1; i < len + 1; i++) {
        res = s.substr(i - current, current).indexOf(s.substr(i, 1));
        // console.log(str.indexOf());
        if (res > -1) {
            if (max < current) {
                max = current;
            }
            current -= res;

        } else {
            current++;
        }
    }

    return max

}

Median of Two Sorted Arrays
---

There are two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively. Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).

```js
var findMedianSortedArrays = function(nums1, nums2) {
    var len1 = nums1.length,
        len2 = nums2.length,
        arr = [],
        iseven = !((len1 + len2) % 2),
        current1 = 0,
        current2 = 0,
        loop = Math.floor((len1 + len2) / 2) + 1;

    for (var i = 0; i < loop; i++) {
        if (current1 == len1) {
            arr.push(nums2[current2]);
            current2++;
            continue;
        }

        if (current2 == len2) {
            arr.push(nums1[current1]);
            current1++;
            continue;
        }

        if (nums1[current1] < nums2[current2]) {
            arr.push(nums1[current1]);
            current1++;
        } else {
            arr.push(nums2[current2]);
            current2++;
        }
    }
    return iseven ? (arr.pop() + arr.pop()) / 2 : arr.pop();
}
